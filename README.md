I am a proactive, curious and creative person who recently graduated an Electronic Engineering with a strong desire for continuous learning and collaboration. Now I am seeking a junior position in a dynamic and diverse team environment, with a focus on sharing knowledge to deliver high-performance results. During graduation, I participated in extension activities, including organizing events and competitions, showcasing teamwork and proactive problem-solving skills. My internship at a Brazilian multinational involved leading an internal process improvement project, resulting in a reduction of incidents through the implementation of best practices. My proficiency in C/C++ programming began with a 3rd place win in a Brazilian IT competition, followed by dedicated coursework and personal projects during my undergraduate years.


## Extra activities

* **Scientific research:** Motion planning simulation of mobile robots and realization of experimental tests using mathematical and software simulations using MATLAB scripts.

* **Competition:** Development of a Robot Soccer Team for the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer category including vision, control, mechanical and electronic system using different software tools, such as MATLAB, C/C++, Python, Qt, Multisim and Fusion360.
## Subjects

1. **Microcontrollers:** 

In this discipline, the objective was to understand how a microcontroller works and develop projects with it. I learned about timers, interrupts, peripheral inputs and others. During this period, I developed projects with motor control using pulse width modulation, measurement of variables such as temperature and speed, and serial communication.

2. **Systems Control:** 

In this subject, I was able to learn about systems control using Simulink/MATLAB to perform simulations on the dynamic response of systems. I used knowledge about transfer functions, creating scripts to simulate inputs and obtain outputs based on the system's behavior.

3. **Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots:** 

General codes on robot planning were developed in the MATLAB environment. In this case, the objective was to calculate a trajectory for the robot to leave an initial position and reach a desired final position.
