I am a proactive, curious and creative person. I seek to learn continuously and I like to work in a dynamic and collaborative team. I have recently graduated in Electronic Engineering at UFS. My current goal is to get a junior position in an environment with diverse and unique people, in which I will be able to constantly learn, share knowledge to deliver a good result with performance.

During my graduation, I focused not only on developing technical skills, but I also participated in extension activities, such as organizing events and competitions that required me to work as a team, proactively and dynamically. My last experience was an internship at a Brazilian multinational, in which my function was conducting an internal process improvement project that led to a reduction in the number of incidents through the creation of good practices and management.

My experiences with the C/C++ programming language began through the Brazilian IT competition, in which I won 3rd place and a university course focused on imperative programming. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in extension activities that allowed me to deepen my knowledge of this language, I took courses that required this skill and I also developed personal projects.



## Extra activities

* **Scientific research:** Motion planning simulation of mobile robots and realization of experimental tests using mathematical and software simulations using MATLAB scripts.

* **Competition:** Development of a Robot Soccer Team for the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer category including vision, control, mechanical and electronic system using different software tools, such as MATLAB, C/C++, Python, Qt, Multisim and Fusion360.
## Subjects

1. **Microcontrollers:** 

In this discipline, the objective was to understand how a microcontroller works and develop projects with it. I learned about timers, interrupts, peripheral inputs and others. During this period, I developed projects with motor control using pulse width modulation, measurement of variables such as temperature and speed, and serial communication.

2. **Systems Control:** 

In this subject, I was able to learn about systems control using Simulink/MATLAB to perform simulations on the dynamic response of systems. I used knowledge about transfer functions, creating scripts to simulate inputs and obtain outputs based on the system's behavior.

3. **Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots:** 

General codes on robot planning were developed in the MATLAB environment. In this case, the objective was to calculate a trajectory for the robot to leave an initial position and reach a desired final position.
